      <p>In 2016 I participated in my first hackathon.</p>
      <p>The teams were created based on the individual person profile. I had a chance to work with multidisciplinary team and it was a great experience.
      Initially, we received a feedback from the idea owner, based on her working experience with patients at hospital.</p>
      <p>Based on the provided data, the issue was to meet the patients need in form of a tool, which could support their daily breath training. The order of the process was following:
      <ol>
        <li>Formulating all the dependencies between patients and their needs: business model was not available, as it was initial step of the tool lifecycle.
        </li>
        <li>Preparing patient profile.
        </li>
        <li>Concepts ideation. Documentation of existing tools (mobile applications).
        </li>
        <li>Creating architecture information, decision to build mobile app.
        </li>
        <p>The first step was done. Based on it, I started generating quick prototypes, while the dev team was preparing programming foundation. It was important to start from objects: which could have been developed further.</p>
